<p>Flowers have long been adored as symbols of beauty, love, fettility, innocence, hope, and other such positvely-connotated words. They have inspired many a greater and lesser individual to write symbolic and lovely prose. <span class="textHL">This is not that.</span> No, while I attempt to be <span class="textToolTipWord">wordy <span class="textToolTipDefinition">sesquipedalian adj. characterized by long words; long-winded</span></span> such that I present myself as well-versed, I am myself not that great at the literary arts. I find it dificult to quantitate and very abstrast, both its strength as well as its weakness. The ambiguity allows interoperability, like a very vague root class or function that serves to create others down the road, which enables literary fans to discuss and develop ideas from the novel at length. But the cost is the lack of structure. That is not to say poetry and novels, as well as their analyses, do not have structure – far from it, developing structured arguements is an essential art to developing well-designed pieces. Simply put, though, the lack of specificty removes the pointedness that more direct approaches may have.</p>
<p>Let us take the Bible, for instance. One of <em>the</em> most alluded to works of all time and the cornerstone of the <a href="https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/largest-religions-in-the-world.html">the world’s largest religion.</a> However, the same heavy use of symbolism and morals that allowed it to survive through numerous centuries also lends itself to the rampant issue of religious sects and denominations: baptist, catholic, methodist, lutheran, etc. Each sect believes in a different interpretation of parts of the Bible and preaching that its view is the correct meaning meant for us. These differences in oppinion can range from nuances on what we are allowed to eat to having slave-owners and the enslaved alike to use the book as the core for their platforms. 1984 has a similar issue: it is a terrific dystopian novel that warns of an overpowering government, but is that government born out of the far right or far left (or both)?</p>
<p>That is why ambiguity can be dangerous, for the freedom it leaves in interpretation by the readers can be abused easily. With mathematics, you can rarely “fluff” a proof or twist words into some axiom. There must be foundation, evidence, and reasoning that definitively proves your claims on the basis of given assumptions. With programming, even random functions are only pseudo-random, everything hinging on the way a programmer writes their software into existence based on defined rules and principles. I thusly appreciate these subjects more. I know that, if I work hard enough, I can find a definitive answer and truth behind any solution (at least in the capacity of anything to be definitive built off of our understanding and assumptions). There is an air of honesty, of skill. You do not have to decipher between truly great poets and those who are merely good at fluff. Not entirely, but it is more black and white, a high-contrast, as opposed to the grey ambiguity of words.</p>
<p>Yet this speaks moreover to my ineptitude more than a universal truth. As a child I adored the concepts of justice – mercy and retribution, punishment and reward. There was a victor, and there was a victim. I was a “tattle-tale” or “snitch” to others, but to myself I was enacting deliverance. When you grow-up, though, you are supposed to shed the “illusion” of a black and white world and don on adulthood with all of its mixed shades.</p>
<p>Indeed, many famous works that are built on the transition (or lack thereof in some cases) from childhood to adulthood use the cracking of the barrier as a major theme: Catcher in the Rye, To Kill a Mockingbird, Tom Sawyer/Huckleberry Finn, Great Expectations, and the rest of the Highschool Reading checklist. The black and white spilling onto a singular canvas, producing a more nuanced and messy picture but one that, supposedly, reflects a truer reality.</p>
<p>Yet, while like most I have of course come to recognize the amiguity of the world, I still like to hold onto the old black and white. It’s soothing, like reliving childhood fantasies. Mind you, I’m not one to hold nolstagia at my core and proclaim daily that the grass was greener yesterday. That said, I still feel child-ish at my core. I still like to enact fantasy adventures, hold to firm rules, and delve into mathematics and programming more than the arts. I suppose most everyone does, though, to some extent.</p>
<p>Which, to vainly try to remain on-topic, I suppose is the reason I do not appreciate flowers that much, or fauna in general for that matter. Yes, they are beautiful (or can be at least), but also messy. They mix and match, varying in color and output. They are dificult to quantify and seperate into sections – where does the root end and the stem begin? How can one wade into an underbrush and count every leaf there? This is not even delving into their literary use. Is a flower only meant to be defiled; does the white petal exist only so that it may be corrupted for whatever moral is needed? The leaves of a stem: all contributing to one goal or competing for resources; competitive cooperation or cooperative competition?</p>
<p>And even with these simple questions you see my dilemna: while offering that these are the “greys,” I still imply a dichotomy. Yes or no, this or that. Maybe this and that but at a ratio. I do not consider instead some more enlightened question free of the built-in assumptions, relating to my refusal to address such open-ended problems. I dislike it, I am not mature or intelligent enough to tackle these problems, and thus incetead of leaving them messily about I deny them conception in the first place. A self-delusion.</p>
<p>It is said that ’tis better to die than be killed. That’s why, I suppose, I deceive myself. I will not have my very way of thinking and foundation shaken by such an innocuous plant. Nay; should I have to drown in the amiguity it will be by my own hand and choosing. The mask of complexity and isolation shall be forged by myself and myself alone to hide the dread of the Grey. I would rather be my own executioner and outwardly prefer black and white for a persona instead of being challenged out in the open by the color of the flower.</p>
<p>Afterall, the deadliest sin is pride. I cannot get over myself enough to even address such core concerns, or perhaps I am simply unwilling. Whatever the case, it makes me hesitant to sit there too long with these colored and silent sirens.</p>
<p>Thank you for stopping and smelling the Roses with me.</p>
