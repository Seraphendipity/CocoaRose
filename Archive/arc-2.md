Uniquity

Being a different person in a world of difference, the deference of difference...
"You're not like other kids." Growing up I was always a bit different. I valued
obedience and respect, I loved my teachers more than my peers, I wanted the
rules to be followed no matter the cost to fun or productivity. I did not care
that I was called a tattle-tale or isolated. I strived to make better grades
and demean myself over making subpar B's. In later years, I made no effort to
fit my ideas and ideals in with the social norms of highschools, actively
speaking up on behalf of my taught values to teachers and students alike, 
regardless of who it hurt.

And by all accounts, being unique and immune to peer pressure should make you
a great character. It should teach you the value of independence, how to lead
rather than follow. The heroic characters of any good underdog story is built
off such a character, who follows an ideal end of morality over the trivial
norms of his day.

And yet that is not the case, whatsoever. I was not immune to peer pressure, I
just reacted to it differently by going the devil's advocate route to make a
stand. I was not a wielder of higher justice, I just favored it when it favored me.
I was not respectful, I simply revelled in the praise I received by using kind
words.

Attempting to parse who I was in the stereotypical High School self-discovery
led to the revelation that, rather than being a unique difference-maker in a
world of normals, I was a casual attention-maker. My actions were not necessarily
in the best interests, but rather in my own interests. Even the self-deprecation of
my own grades and the like served not to humble myself, but rather to enforce
further my own perceived superiority -- if I consider my better score to be bad,
then what does that make your "good" score? It's like winning a ballgame and, in
a backhanded compliment, claiming you were not even trying. It's a selfish 
attempt to further emphasize the gap between you and those around you.

This is not what Jesus wanted (probably). True humility is admitting your
imperfections both in the dark and outloud. It's easy to don a mask and act 
falsely humble in the presence of a crowd, indeed it's gratifying. Hard is it 
to then admit your faults to yourself in the mirror. That is, until you wear
that same mask with yourself, and your lies become your truths in some twisted
masochistic sense where you insult yourself to boost your own ego. At which
point, you've screwed up, as the true intentions of even your own conciousness
is hidden in behind veiled bars. And by you, I of course mean me, but it is 
easier to say these things of someone else... or is it more gratifying to
suddenly make these mistakes my own?




"You're not like the others"; "you're different"; "you're unique". Somehow,
we've (and by we I mean society or perhaps just individuals on their own, 
assuming a difference in those two) created a temple to uniquity, to differece.
Perhaps rooted in the mindset that groupthink pervades everybpdy but ourselves,
or lost in the fantasies of books and shows with an MC, we, or rather I, want
to be different because then I have meaning and purpose as something "other",
even if my purpose is defined in something such as wanting to become part of the
group. On the surface, "other" seems bad and thus we do not mind labelling ourselves
as such for it has that same gratifying self-deprecation -- insulting yourself
typically only leads to someone else or yourself thinking/saying you are not as
bad as that (in opposition to saying you are good and thinking/saying you are
not as good as that). It's sort of a twisted mindset, but one which, I believe,
most can relate, hence my rapid switching between subjects here. 

Yet, it's almost necessary. See, as a sentient species we've run into a brick
wall made of our own success. There are billions of us, all thinking, breathing,
and supposedly important and unique beings. "Each one has their own personality
unlike anyone else, each his own story to tell." The question that plagues me, 
however, is the question of how many significantly different stories are there to
tell. How many people do you have to know before they all become a blur?
I find it hard to believe, for whatever reason, that every and each individual
ever created is so unique so as to have been an unprecedented and truly other being.
Heck, protagonists are largely redundant over the trillions of stories
we've created, as we can all relate to them in some capacity -- how do we 
reconcile these largely shared motives and beliefs with the supposed uniquity of
each individual?

These are answerless questions, or if they do have answers, then I am taking
the lazy approach here in attempting to sound "deep and brooding" by asking
kindegarten-level philosophy questions that "challenge the reader" in the same
manner that writing an algebraic equation of 200 variables and leaving it to the
reader to solve is revealing of a mathematician's mindset. 

It haunts me, though, to think of how truly redundant I am. All the mothers and
fathers and brothers and sisters can declare their eternal love and sing praises
of how "good" or "nice" or "unique" someone is, but it does not change the
fact that my actions, both noble and selfish, are moreover a result of my inner
struggle to have a seperate identity which I cannot claim. Perhaps that's the 
point -- we have to stop "soul-searching" for some existential and personal meaning
and accept a truth outside of ourselves, such as the belief in Jesus Christ our
Lord and Saviour, or for those less inclinded to Christianity, perhaps Science
and logic.

If that is the case, then I think that we do create these illusions of 
character for our own necessary amusement. Taking a relaxing afternoon, discussing
drama of a coworker, babysitting the next door neighbor, playing a game of
pool with the bois, hanging under the ol' hilltop tree to gaze on the sunset
with your beloved, spending the afternoon away from work with your kid, 
enjoying a well-cooked meal with a client, having a deep conversation about freewill
with your uncle, talking about your summer vacation online with your friends...
these are largely redundant affairs, used to break up the monotony. The 
overwhelming, inescapable, crushing monotony of day to day life. Even wars are
less a matter of defeating a menace or taking land or fighting for ideals, but 
moreover a means to escape our own depressingly empty peace-times. If we can
distract ourself with a mission, a purpose, a hero, a villian, a story, or some
drama to drown out the thoughts of sheer existential boredom, or ennui, it's
likely worth it. 

Man is his own worst enemy. Not in an external sense necessarily, or an interal
struggle, but rather our own success as a creature capable of thinking and
rationalizing meaning and purpose, we struggle to define that for ourselves
without faith in some sort of denomination, be that the facilities of logic and
mathematics hinging on self-proving axioms or a church hinging on a self-proving
God. We need some internally consistent process and way of thought in order
to discern a goal and purpose, for without it, we are lost to our own abysses.

And so we fall into the trap of nilhism, acting like an edgy 12 year old kid
talking about the meaninglessness and vanity of it all, and realizing that our,
no, MY entire thought process has been a vain attempt at crafting a narrative of
uniquity for myself -- by deconstructing my beliefs and the beliefs of others
I can become an ubermensch to validate my own set of ideals. Except, of course,
I do not have such ideals, for they were built on deconstructing themselves.

And then I sigh. Stuck in a loop of questioning my questions and solving them
with the tools I used to create and deconstruct those very same tools --
a platitudeness and needless process. I speak in circles, weaving a pseudo
meta-narrative which, I hope, is internally consistent enough to give it 
purpose, but little is stopping the meta narrative from collapsing in on itself
from its sheer absurdity and uselessness.

So what's my point here? Would it be more fitting/authentic to insert a sentence about how
there is no purpose here, or make it a trivial purpose to  contrast with the 
high stakes presented above, or maybe a question, or maybe better yet a meta
question that includes itself for slight humor effect?

And then I sigh. Again. If there's one thing I know, it's that I do not know,
paraphrasing Goethe or whomever fathered epistimeology (close enough). However,
it was not exactly without results. I recognize that my stunts and antics, such
as riding a unicycle or wearing a catsuit or liking loli pictures or doting
on my little sister are less true reflections of myself and moreover shadows
of the puppet mask in the Cave, charades I perform to amuse others and, mostly,
myself; a lie I perpetuate to give myself some characteristics. Like a character
in a story, defining myself by some likes and dislikes, ideals and flaws. Just...
less interesting, which is why I still get distracted by fantasy worlds where
the concocted characters are somehow more authentic than my ownself.

It makes me jealous, perhaps even a bit angry. These eternal figures, entirely
fictional and by our own creation, somehow hold not just more power and interesting
relationships, but true authenticity to theirselves. They do not have to lie
to their own thoughts to maintain a semblance of 
<span class="ToolTip">eptitude<span class="ToolTipText">
I know it's not a real word but I like it and leave me alone</span></span>
. They have a defined,
even if they are stripped of their free-will in the process. They live as we
wish we could. And yet, I wonder if they envy us as the angels in heaven do, for
even if our volition is damning and isolating to the extreme, it gives connections,
however shallow, more inherent meaning. Possibly. As you can tell with the wishy-washiness
of my statements, likely given the choice of the two I would be eternally frozen.

No, actually, I take that back. Who am I kidding I would choose the determinism,
perhaps regret it later, but at least that regret can be blamed elsewhere in my own
mind, should that elsewhere will it.

And then I sigh. I want to lose myself in the love of Christ,
in a passion for coding, in the hugs of loved ones, until I am drunk on my own
hypocrises. Maybe in doing so I can attain rest from vanities, and derive some
satisfaction in my doing and being.

Maybe not. Who knows? Certainly not myself. Or am I just saying that to avoid an
answer and further self-deprecate myself to give myself meanin-

Sigh.
