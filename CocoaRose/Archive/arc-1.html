<p>Gaming has been a part of my life since I was a kid. Snuggled up with my dad as he shot one demon in the face after another, or beating down aliens in Halo, I have always been invested in the action. That is not to say I have played exclusively action games, as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy">RTS</a>’s are one of my favorite genres. I appreciate all manner of videogames and the tropes they utilize to craft a narrative.</p>
<p>I believe it has become more and more apparent to even non-gamers that videogames are not the “rot your brain dumb shooter fest” that they are sometimes stereotyped as. Games represent more, and have become a hobby, medium, and art form in their own right.</p>
<p>Consider fightings games like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekken"></a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Smash_Bros">Super Smash Bros. series</a> , franchises that have brought millions of players together to compete in a mindgame relatively devoid of typical biases and limitations: man or woman, deaf or weak, paralyzed or strong, few things stop you from becoming the best except your own willpower, determination, and S tier broken tomfoolery like whatever Meta Knight was supposed to be (no Im not salty at all why do you ask).</p>
<p>Or take <a href="">Undertale</a> or Hollow Knight, which are undeniable masterpieces with excellent story-telling, trope subversions, and enjoyable characters. Minecraft, a seemingly simple and mundane game that inspired many to creative enterprises as well as pushing several thousands of kids of age 10 or younger to try coding and modding (which can lead to valuable real life skills).</p>
<p>Games also have the ability that no movie can fully emulate, which is the extent of viewer participation. Spec Ops: The Line would have been a good action movie, deconstructing the “USA Solider Good, Foreigners Bad” tropes running rampant through many works, but it is all the more powerful when you, the player, (spoilers) press the button that chemically tortures and kills hundreds of innocents, or pull the trigger to murder a former marine officer. Farcry 3 with a similar deconstruction would have not been the same if you simply watched Jason become an inhuman slaughterer, as you are detached from him and would likely empathize with his friends and write him off as crazy; it is more convincing, however, when you are performing bad-to-the-bone feats like slitting the throat of a pirate before tomahawking his friend and burning th rest of them to the ground whilst paragliding – the first-person PoV and typical “upgrade on lvl up and be good-er” expectation of games contrasts and masks with the increasingly violent and animalistic brutality of Jason as he exceeds even the antagonists in raw ferocity, and it is not till the end that the player is shown the logical conclusion of his journey, eventually becoming worst than those he killed and losing his initial motives by gaining power. (Note: I know these two are contraversial in regards to these plot elements and how effective they were in their roles, and there are better examples, but I personally like these two).</p>
<p>And now, we are going further. With the growing power, reliability, and prevelence of not only AR but also VR, new ideas and stories can be told in ways never before (though, sadly, I have yet to see such a story emerge yet). I can walk into a pub as an animated little girl to sit with my friend residing in China who appears as Garfield the cat while Abraham Lincoln from India sings Megalovania with his animate little girl pet (there are a lot of animated little girls, along wtih Ugandan knuckles). Never before could people be so easily and fully immersed into worlds that are not he result of natural creation, but rather completely digital information and calculations.</p>
<p>What is my point in saying all of this? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. I just needed content and wanted to rave on videogames. If you want an actually meaningful post: first, remove the link at the top, second, type in literally anything else except this site’s name. Bye now.</p>
