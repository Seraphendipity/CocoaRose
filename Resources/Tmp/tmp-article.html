<p>Sugar gliders are quite adorable, if you have ever seen one. They hail from Australia, and being marsupials are related to kangaroos, koalas, and the like. Their most distinctive feature, perhaps, is their webbed together limbs that form a glider of sorts, allowing them to soften their landings and jump between branches and such.</p>
<p>Gliders are somewhat exotic pets, but not anymore than, say, foxes are. They live long lives (15+ years) and are very social animals that bond to humans and their own. They can become very emotionally attached, to the extent of becoming depressed and even suicidal in isolation. They ae also quite intelligent, capable of learning their name and some tricks, not unlike a small dog or cat. Their biggest pro – or con, depending on what type of person you are – is that they are nocturnal (hence the big black eyes and typically dull fur-color). This means that they sleep during the day, and as such, are great “pocket pets”, riding in a pouch or pocket throughout the day while occasionally waking up to eat or potty or eat. However, this also means that at night they go absolutely bat-out-of-heck crazy, jumping to and fro and running about. For some this can be a huge drawback, hindering the sleep of the owner, however certain nocturnal professions (i.e. engineering and gamers) enjoy these hours of excitement and play as well. For some brief info about them, I created this dossier (parodying <a href="">Ark: Survival Evolved</a>’s style): <img class="arcImg" src="../Images/img-0016-HQ-SugarGliderDossier.png"></img> Don’t be fooled: the “drawings” are merely images of real gliders with a fair bit of editing. I think. It’s been some years…</p>
<p>Regarding my personal possession of these critters, I had two during highschool, after my parents decided to get me these instead of a cat. Although at first hesitant, I grew to love my two girls very much. Unfortunately, like everything under my care, they died a few years later.</p>
<p>I have recently (6.30.2019) acquired two new gliders, though, and plan to make them good pets. I am a big fan of cute things (which some see as creepy but that’s for another day), and as such gliders bring me good deal of joy – they’re extremely soft and they make a purring-esque vibration when they are cold or happy and snuggling up to you. Plus, there are few things in the world more adorable than handing a half-grape or apple slice and watching the little ones chew on it merrily. In my experience, they also like to curl up on your belly, or sit on your shoulder and watch you play games or work, occasionally “kissing” your nose/cheek or stick their heads in or around your ear to tickle. That’s why I love them – so small, yet such dense fluffiness and cuteness.</p>
